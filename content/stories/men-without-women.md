The house had grown silent. It was not an empty silence, but a thick, lingering one, something that settled into the corners of the rooms and made itself comfortable. The father and son lived in it now, the two of them moving through the days like figures in a clockwork routine, predictable and dull.

Once, it had been different. There had been voices, footsteps that carried a rhythm, the sharp sound of laughter breaking against the walls. There had been warmth, though not always in words—sometimes in the way a meal appeared at the right time, or in the way clothes were folded just so. That was when his wife was still alive, when his daughters still lived at home. Now, it was just the two of them, left to manage the spaces that once held more than just themselves.

Surendra was fifty-five. He did not have many friends, nor did he care to keep in touch with the few relatives he had. He preferred solitude, or at least, he had convinced himself that he did. His world had grown smaller after his wife’s passing, and the effort of expanding it again seemed too much. His son, at fourteen, had a world of his own, though it did not resemble that of most boys his age. He spoke when he needed to, but the concept of emotional connection was something distant to him. He did not seem to understand that his mother was gone, at least not in the way his father did. Death, absence, longing—these were abstractions he could not grasp or at least not in the way that other people do.

The boy depended on his father for many things: eating, bathing, getting dressed. Some days were harder than others. Some mornings, he refused to put on his socks, sitting on the floor with his bare feet, unbothered by the cold. Some nights, he would not eat unless his father fed him, one spoonful at a time. These small battles were never won or lost, only endured. The father had learned patience. He had learned to live without expecting thanks.

The kitchen told the story of their new life best. It was no longer a place of quiet industry, of hands kneading chapati dough or stirring a fragrant pot of dal. The steel containers that once held fresh chutneys and pickles now sat empty. The spice rack, once a vibrant array of masalas, gathered dust. Now, there were plastic bags from the local restaurants stacked on the counter, stainless steel plates left in the sink longer than they should be. They ate without ceremony, mostly while engaged in separate mobile phones, their words clipped and practical.

“Take a bite,” the father would say.

The boy would chew, distracted, his eyes on the screen.

Laundry piled up in odd places. The boy’s clothes were always slightly askew—shirts buttoned unevenly, socks mismatched. The house had never been pristine, but it had never felt quite this unkempt either. Dust settled faster now, or maybe it had always settled at this rate, and they were just noticing it for the first time.

At night, the father sometimes stood by the window, looking out into the quiet street. He thought about how his wife used to stand there too, watching the girls as they came home. He thought about the sound of their voices, the way they argued over things that seemed small now—who had taken whose sweater, who had borrowed a book and left it out in the rain. Those arguments had meant something then. They meant that life was full, that things were still moving. Now, the house was still. The kind of stillness that wasn’t peaceful, just hollow.

The son spent his evenings differently. He sat in his room, arranging objects in neat rows—books, toys, pencils, things that had no real use but could not be discarded. He did not bring people over, not that he had many friends to bring. The house did not feel like a place for guests.
Once, the father had asked his son if he missed his mother.

The boy had looked at him, eyes unfocused. “She’s not here.”

“I know.”

The boy had returned to his toy car, lining it up perfectly against the others. The conversation ended there.
The idea of having a second partner had come and gone quickly, like a bird landing on a branch before taking flight again. There was no space for someone else. His life was already full, in its own difficult, uneven way.

They were men without women now. They did what they had to do. They got up, they worked, they ate, they slept. They carried on. There was no tragedy in it, not exactly. Just the quiet, unremarkable weight of life as it was.
